# CSC-412-Maze
This repository uses different searching strategies to solve a maze represented by a 2D array.

The purpose of this program is to create an agent that can process a maze. 
The maze will be a 10x10 grid represented by a 2D array. 
The entry will be designated with an 'E', and the exit will be designated with an 'X'.
The path that can be traveled in the maze will be designated with a 'P', and the walls
will be designated with a 'W'. All perimeter locations other than the entrance and exit
will be a 'W'.
